# Deployment Scripts Comparison

## Key Differences Found

### 1. SuccinctStaking Deployment & Initialization

**Individual Script (SuccinctStaking.s.sol):**
- Deploys implementation
- Deploys proxy WITH initialization data (lines 26-47)
- Initializes the contract during proxy deployment

**All.s.sol:**
- `_deployStakingAsProxy()`: Deploys proxy with EMPTY initialization data (line 101: `""`))
- `_initializeStaking()`: Calls initialize() separately after deployment (line 121)

**Impact:** The deployment order differs - individual script initializes immediately, while All.s.sol deploys first then initializes later.

### 2. Return Value Mismatch in All.s.sol

**_deployVAppAsProxy() function:**
- Function signature (line 64): `returns (address, address)` - expects 2 return values
- Return statement (line 94): `return (VERIFIER, VAPP, VAPP_IMPL);` - returns 3 values
- Calling code (line 28-29): expects 2 values `(address VAPP, address VAPP_IMPL)`

This is a compilation error. The function should return `(VAPP, VAPP_IMPL)` to match both the signature and usage. The `VERIFIER` is just read from config and shouldn't be returned.

### 3. Missing Initialize Function in Individual Script

The README.md shows a two-step process for SuccinctStaking:
1. Deploy: `forge script SuccinctStakingScript --broadcast`
2. Initialize: `forge script SuccinctStakingScript --sig "initialize()" --broadcast`

However, the SuccinctStaking.s.sol script only has a `run()` function that does both deployment and initialization. There's no separate `initialize()` function to match the README instructions.

## Summary

The All.s.sol script does NOT match the individual scripts exactly:

1. **SuccinctStaking initialization timing is different** - immediate vs deferred
2. **Bug in All.s.sol** - incorrect return value in `_deployVAppAsProxy()`
3. **Missing functionality** - SuccinctStaking.s.sol lacks the separate initialize() function mentioned in README

The other scripts (IntermediateSuccinct, SuccinctGovernor, SuccinctVApp) appear to match correctly.
