This is the monorepo for the Succinct Prover Network, a protocol on Ethereum that coordinates a 
distributed network of provers to generate zero knowledge proofs for any piece of software. This 
protocol creates a two-sided marketplace between provers and requesters, enabling anyone to receive 
proofs for applications such as blockchains, bridges, oracles, AI agents, video games, and more.

## Overview

This repository offers the following components:

- **Contracts**: Solidity smart contracts for the protocol, including the $PROVE ERC20 token, 
staking mechanisms, and the network's settlement contract.
- **Verifiable Application**: The networkâ€™s state transition function, handling tasks such as balance
management, proof clearing, and more, is implemented as verifiable RISC-V programs, proven using SP1.
- **Reference Prover**: We provide a reference prover implementation that demonstrates a basic 
interaction with the network, including bidding and generating a proof.

More in-depth documentation is available in our [docs](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/network/introduction)
and also in the READMEs in each relevant folder.
